"Hello I am Baymax your personal Health Care companion".

In this assignment, when my program is run the quote above is the first thing you will hear.
Essentially my project is a futuristic user interface inspired my the movie Big Hero 6.

My program replicated Baymax(the robotic nurse) scanning interface which involves:

1. Scanner --- made with animated arc and a rectangle that descends.
2. Main background is an image of a person which his Hiro the main character in the movie
3. Charts which mimics the effect that its data is take from the scanner this includes:
  --on the left hand side of the screen
  LINE GRAPH with ellipse points
  animated BAR GRAPH
  PIE CHART
  
 The really cool thing about this INTERFACE is its easy to use and its provides the chance for the user to be educated.
 
 How? 
 
 So when a user click and hold on to the "beating heart" it will display a somewhat
 MICROSCOPIC view of the blood cells of the person who is currently being scanned.
 
 This is an animation of the movement of blood cells made with ellipse and a touch of magic.
 
 Also when the user clicks on to the top left brain , it will display the labelled parts of the brain.
 
 In addition to that, when the bottom brain situated on the left of the screen is clicked and hold,
 an INTERACTIVE line graph with a slider will appear.
 
 Overall this program is unique,simple yet sophisticated.
